# json-toolbox README

`json-toolbox` is a work-in-progress VSCode extension that will provide some
common JSON-related utilities like minify, prettify, quote-escape,
and unquote-escape.

To be honest I'm only really making this extension since none of the
already-existing extensions which provide this functionality (that I know of)
meet the criteria to be used at my work (open-source and JS-only).


## Features - WIP

### Prettify
Format JSON into something easy to read.

### Minify
Take all the JSON and make it into one minified line.

### Quote escape
Escape all quotes in a JSON blob. Very useful when passing JSON into something
like a `curl` argument.

### Quote unescape
Unescape all quotes from a JSON blob.
