# DEVELOPMENT.md

This file contains a development guide.


## Prerequisites

- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and Node, see what versions you need
in `package.json`.
- In VSCode, open the `json-toolbox.code-workspace` workspace and install
any extensions you are recommended.
  - When working in this repo you should do it from the workspace.


## Building and testing

As with most Node packages, look in `package.json` to see available commands.
The important ones:
- `pnpm install` - Install dependencies
- `pnpm release` - Typecheck, lint, build, and test
